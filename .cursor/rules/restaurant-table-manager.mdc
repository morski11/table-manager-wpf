# Restaurant Table Manager - Project Guidelines

## Project Overview

A WPF desktop application for restaurant waiters to manage customer orders across multiple tables.

## Core Features

- **Table Management**: Create/remove tables with custom names
- **Order Management**: Create orders within tables, add items (name, price, quantity)
- **Order Completion**: Mark orders as complete
- **Multi-Table Support**: Handle multiple active tables simultaneously

## Architecture

Use **MVVM pattern** with:
- `Models/` - Data classes (Table, Order, OrderItem)
- `ViewModels/` - Business logic and UI state
- `Views/` - XAML UI definitions
- `Services/` - Shared services (if needed)

## Performance Requirements

### UI Responsiveness
```csharp
// ✅ Use async/await for any potentially slow operations
await Task.Run(() => ProcessOrder(order));

// ✅ Use ObservableCollection for dynamic lists
public ObservableCollection<Table> Tables { get; }

// ❌ Never block UI thread
Thread.Sleep(1000); // BAD
```

### Memory Efficiency
- Use `IDisposable` for resources
- Clear completed orders from memory when no longer needed
- Avoid large object allocations in hot paths

## UI Guidelines

- Clean, minimal interface with clear visual hierarchy
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Provide visual feedback for actions (loading states, confirmations)
- Support keyboard navigation for speed

## Code Standards

- XML documentation on public members
- Descriptive naming (e.g., `CompleteOrderCommand`, `ActiveTables`)
- Keep ViewModels testable - no direct UI dependencies
- Use `ICommand` for button actions (RelayCommand/DelegateCommand pattern)
